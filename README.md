Codebase structure
The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented below:

< PROJECT ROOT >

   |-- core/                            
   |    |-- settings.py                  # Project Configuration

How to Customize
When a template file is loaded, Django scans all template directories starting from the ones defined by the user, and returns the first match or an error in case the template is not found. The theme used to style this starter provides the following files:

# This exists in ENV: LIB/admin_material
< UI_LIBRARY_ROOT >                      
   |
   |-- templates/                     # Root Templates Folder 
   |    |          
   |    |-- accounts/       
   |    |    |-- login.html           # Sign IN Page
   |    |    |-- register.html        # Sign UP Page
   |    |
   |    |-- includes/       
   |    |    |-- footer.html          # Footer component
   |    |    |-- sidebar.html         # Sidebar component
   |    |    |-- navigation.html      # Navigation Bar
   |    |    |-- scripts.html         # Scripts Component
   |    |
   |    |-- layouts/       
   |    |    |-- base.html            # Masterpage
   |    |    |-- base-auth.html       # Masterpage for Auth Pages
   |    |
   |    |-- pages/       
   |         |-- index.html           # Dashboard Page
   |         |-- profile.html         # Profile Page
   |         |-- *.html               # All other pages
   |    
   |-- ************************************************************************
When the project requires customization, we need to copy the original file that needs an update (from the virtual environment) and place it in the template folder using the same path.

For instance, if we want to customize the footer.html these are the steps:

âœ… Step 1: create the templates DIRECTORY inside the home app
âœ… Step 2: configure the project to use this new template directory
core/settings.py TEMPLATES section
âœ… Step 3: copy the footer.html from the original location (inside your ENV) and save it to the home/templates DIR
Source PATH: <YOUR_ENV>/LIB/admin_material/template/includes/footer.html
Destination PATH: <PROJECT_ROOT>home/templates/includes/footer.html
To speed up all these steps, the codebase is already configured (Steps 1, and 2) and a custom footer can be found at this location:

home/templates/includes/custom_footer.html

By default, this file is unused because the theme expects footer.html (without the custom- prefix).

In order to use it, simply rename it to footer.html. Like this, the default version shipped in the library is ignored by Django.

In a similar way, all other files and components can be customized easily.
